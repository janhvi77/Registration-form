💻 HTML Registration Form — My First Web Project

Welcome to my very first HTML project — a simple user registration form built using pure HTML. This project helped me understand the basics of web development and how to structure web forms effectively.

🧩 Problem Statement

Every website or app needs a way to collect user information — whether for sign-ups, feedback, or user profiles. I wanted to understand how forms work in HTML, and how to structure them semantically to collect key user data like name, email, password, and preferences.


---

🔨 What I Built

A clean and simple Registration Form that includes:

Name input (text)

Email input (email validation)

Password input (hidden characters)

Gender selection (radio buttons)

Country selection (dropdown menu)

Submit button



---

🧠 What I Learned

While building this form, I learned:

How to use various HTML <input> types effectively

How to group related inputs using <form>

The importance of using <label> and name attributes for accessibility and data handling

The role of semantic HTML and how to structure content logically



---

⚙️ Tech Used

HTML5 (only)

No external CSS or JavaScript yet — kept it simple and focused on HTML structure



---

🧗 Challenges I Faced

Understanding the difference between type="text" and type="email"

Learning how radio buttons work with shared name attributes

Keeping the structure clean and readable without CSS styling

Figuring out how to align and space form elements neatly



---

🚀 Next Steps

I plan to improve this project by:

Adding CSS to make the form responsive and visually appealing

Adding form validation using JavaScript

Connecting it to a backend (using PHP or Firebase) to store user data

Hosting the form live using GitHub Pages or Netlify
